phpsploit disclaimer
====================

Written by nil0x42 (https://bitbucket.org/nil0x42)

Please note that this software is not made to help cyber criminals to keep
access on remote servers unlawfully.

Phpsploit is first and foremost a proof of concept, designed for a better
understanding of the intricacies of the HTTP protocol.

It is also very useful for administrators monitoring their website through a
shared host without ssh access. Because the framework, and especially with
it's PASSKEY feature, can easily simulate a basic shell access.

Never use the phpsploit backdoor on a website without strict consent of it's
official owner.
