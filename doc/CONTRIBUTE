Writing patches for phpsploit
=============================

If you want to create a patch for the framework's core, enhance documentation,
submit a plugin, or any other kind of phpsploit contribution, please take
a look at the following lines, which explain the better way to contribute,
keeping our both lives easier :)

First, you should clone my repository:
    $ git clone https://nil0x42@bitbucket.org/nil0x42/phpsploit.git

Go to your local version of phpsploit:
    $ cd phpsploit

Now in your local repository, make all the changes you want, update code,
etc...

When you're satisfied with all you changes, it's time to create a single
patch, which will contain all your commits:
    $ git format-patch origin/master --stdout > bugfix.patch

Send the patch to nil0x42 <http://goo.gl/kb2wf>


The above method is better than basic patches, because the git's format-patch
feature defaultly includes extra data, like commit messages, and author
informations.

Or course, if you have a bitbucket account, the best way to send phpsploit
enhancements would be to directly send a pull request:
- https://bitbucket.org/nil0x42/phpsploit/pull-request/new


If the above instructions appear complicated, you probably are not familiarized
with git, so I suggest you visit this great tutorial:

Enhancing phpsploit's documentation
===================================

Please note that the <./README> and <./doc/MANUAL> are generated files, using
as source the file below:
    ./framework/misc/user-manual.txt2tags

So if you want to increase the documentation provided by one of these files,
please edit the source template instead.
