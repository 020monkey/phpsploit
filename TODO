Interface:

Settings:

Sessions:
  * Add retrocompatibility with `phpsploit v1` sessions (ticket #13).
  * when connecting to a target with `exploit`, if the session has changes,
    show the diff and ask user for confirmation to know if writeable env
    vars can be removed

Core:
  * Implement a $PAYLOAD_PREFIX setting to allow custom php tricks
    on each request, before all payload executions.
  * Before exiting framework, if the session has changed, compared to
    binded phpsploit session file, we must prompt user for confirmation.

Commands:
  * `session save` needs a '-f' (force) option.
  * remote shell @exit needs a -f opt to bypass leave confirmation in case of
    unsaved session.
  * Add a `bind` core command to bind the prompt to a plugin.

Plugins:
  * Write a "plugins/network/scan/plugin.py" small ip scanner, to be able to
    progressively gain access on controlled server's internal network.
  * A `stat` plugin should be created with new API. This one will replace
    the current and deprecated `fileinfo` plugin.

Documentation:
  * Simplify the manpage to summarize only commands and how to get started
  * When all this done, the 'rtfm' core command can be removed
  * Add autocompletion for `help set <SETTING>` commands

Network Stealth:
  * Write a stealth module which use other target on each command (with 404)
