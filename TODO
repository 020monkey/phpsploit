Interface:

Settings:

Sessions:

Core:
  * Update session backwards compat with new default env var names

Commands:
  * @doc core command must be created, to handle ./doc/ reading from interface
  * @save needs an '-f' (force) option to force file overwrite
  * remote shell @exit needs a -f opt to bypass leave confirmation in case of
    unsaved session.

Plugins:
  * Write a "plugins/network/scan/plugin.py" small ip scanner, to be able to
    progressively gain access on controlled server's internal network.

Documentation:
  * Move current ./doc files to the root dir
  * The new ./doc dir must contain complete markdown documentation
  * Write a nice README which summarizes the framework's goal and features
  * Simplify the manpage to summarize only commands and how to get started
  * When all this done, the 'rtfm' core command can be removed

Network Stealth:
  * Write a stealth module which use other target on each command (with 404)
