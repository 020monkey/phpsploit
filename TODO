Interface:
  * BUG: changing terminal size (SIGWINCH) makes readline prompt buggy
    on muliline commands.

Settings:

Sessions:
  * when connecting to a target with `exploit`, if the session has changes,
    show the diff and ask user for confirmation to know if writeable env
    vars can be removed.
  * session saving shall ask user confirmation if session changed.

Core:
  * Add a way to get return code of previous command (like bash's '$?')
  * Provide bzip2 payload encoding (php >= 4.0.4, with bzcompress())
    We need smaller payloads !

Commands:
  * Add a `bind` core command to bind the prompt to a plugin.
  * Add `corectl debug-http-request` command for watching payload construction
    and responses steps within a debug buffer displayed on $EDITOR.

Plugins:
  * Write a "plugins/network/scan/plugin.py" small ip scanner, to be able to
    progressively gain access on controlled server's internal network.

Documentation:
  * Simplify the manpage to summarize only commands and how to get started
  * When all this is done, the 'rtfm' core command can be removed
  * Add autocompletion for `help set <SETTING>` commands

Network Stealth:
  * Write a stealth module which use other target on each command (with 404)
