This readme contains a brief description of each file on that directory.

./user-manual.txt2tags

    This is a text file which uses the txt2tags's minimalistic markup syntax
    and is designed to generate the phpsploit's README/MANUAL. You should edit
    this file if you want to submit any patch related to the documentation.


./settings.tpl

    The settings.tpl is a template file, and contains a basic preformated
    version of the user configuration file (a.k.a. "~/.phpsploit/config")


./http_user_agents.lst

    This file contains a list (one per line) of common browser user agents.
    It is defaultly used as HTTP_USER_AGENT setting, as a file object because
    file objects (aka file://PATH), when used as HTTP_* settings (http headers)
    will randomly pick-up a line from these files.


./help.msg

    This file just contains the string returned when the "--help" argument is
    given from the command line.


./logo.ascii

    This file contains the ascii art string used as logo by phpsploit.


./intro.msg

    It contains the introduction message, written right below the ascii logo.


./messages.lst

    This useless file just contains a list of quotes, randomly picked-up and
    printed on framework start/end.
