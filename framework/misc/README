#This readme contains a brief description of each file on that directory.

./manual-page.txt2tags
======================
    This is a text file which uses the txt2tags's minimalistic markup syntax
    and is designed to generate the PhpSploit's manual page creation template,
    using the txt2tags syntax. You should edit this file if you want to submit
    a man page update.


./manual-page.1
===============
    This file must not be edited by hand, it is the PhpSploit's manual page,
    generated from the "./manual-page.txt2tags" file.


./settings.tpl
==============
    The settings.tpl is a template file, and contains a basic preformated
    version of the user configuration file (a.k.a. "~/.phpsploit/config")


./http_user_agents.lst
======================
    This file contains a list (one per line) of common browser user agents.
    It is defaultly used as HTTP_USER_AGENT setting, as a file object because
    file objects (aka file://PATH), when used as HTTP_* settings (http headers)
    will randomly pick-up a line from these files.


./help.msg
==========
    This file just contains the string returned when the "--help" argument is
    given from the command line.


./logo.ascii
============
    This file contains the ascii art string used as logo by the PhpSploit
    framework interface at start.


./intro.msg
===========
    It contains the introduction message, written right below the ascii logo.


./messages.lst
==============
    This useless file contains a list of quotes, randomly picked-up and
    printed on framework start/end, just for fun!
