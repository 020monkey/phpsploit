the ./lib dir contains any library that is external, or not directly involved
with phpsploit.

CONTENTS:
    * phpserialize.py
        It is an external library, keep it as it is (without vacksyn patch),
        and don't belive to add author credit and licence if different.

    * clipy.py
        Based on Cmd lib from python standards, the phpsploit'one have been
        a lot modified/enhanced and claims it's own name now. Of course
        the author of the original one must be credited anyway.
        NOTE: must be cleaned to be an independent library, usable by
        other softwares as a standard library.
