# The PhpSploit configuration file can be considered as a source
# file which is defaultly sourced at framework initialisation.
#
# It means that you just have to put the commands as you type them in
# the PhpSploit shell interface in order to build your own configuration.
#
# NOTE: If any command fails, the phpsploit framework will fail to
#       load this configuration file.


### Those aliases are enabled by default for retrocompatibility
### purposes. Feel free to remove them if you don't use them !
alias target    "set TARGET"
alias load      "session load"
alias save      "session save"
alias infect    "exploit"
alias lcd       "lrun cd"
alias lpwd      "lrun pwd"


### Some configuration examples you may want to add:

## set your own PASSKEY to prevent other phpsploit users use your backdoors.
# set PASSKEY "YourPassKey"

## Better use the best editor within phpsploit ;)
# set EDITOR "vim"

## An useful shortcut, aliasing `edit` command with your prefered editor..
# alias vim     "edit"
