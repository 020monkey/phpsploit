# The PhpSploit configuration file can be considered as a source
# file which is defaultly sourced at framework initialisation.
#
# It means that you just have to put the commands as you type them in
# the PhpSploit shell interface in order to build your own configuration.


### Those aliases are enabled by default for retrocompatibility
### purposes. Feel free to remove them if you don't use them !
alias target    "set target"
alias load      "session load"
alias save      "session save"
alias infect    "exploit"


### Some configuration examples you may want to add:

## set your own PASSKEY to prevent other phpsploit users use your backdoors.
# set PASSKEY "YourPassKey"

## use vim as text editor because all other editors sucks !
# set EDITOR "vim"

## bypass vimist habits by aliasing 'edit' to 'vim'.
# alias vim     "edit"
